3. Design 
    1.Design choice
        The webpage was designed with keeping the store and the logo in vision, giving its user experience of colour, happiness and comfort. 
    2.Colour
        When choosing the colour scheme, I kept the colourful cakes and happiness one feel when they eat a cake. Also keeping the logo in mind, I went for pink and light colours. 
    3.Fonts
        When deciding on the font I kept the logo in mind and how the cake gives a smooth. So, I chose dancing script for my heading matching my logo and caveat so it's easy-to-read the content. 
    4.Strucure
        Upon arriving on the website, the user sees the logo with navigation bar which takes them to any of the pages they would like. Thus, on any of the pages if the user were to click on the logo it would take them to home page. the website consists of four pages:
            A home page with two section one for Daily Flavours of cupcake and brownies and News section. 
            A about page that tells you about the store, the ingredient the store uses and how everything is freshly every day. 
            A product page that gives you option to choose from cakes, wedding Cakes, Cupcakes and Brownies.
            A contact us page that has a form allowing user to send us a message, information on how contact store and a Map to find teh store. 

        Basicly the structue of the website is simple easy to learn your way and find what user is looking for.
